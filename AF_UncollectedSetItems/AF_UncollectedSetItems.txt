; Changelog:
;
; Version 2.1.0 (2021/03/08)
; * Added a new "Any" option to filter for items that are uncollected by and
;   tradeable with any account, if multiple accounts are tracked
;
; Version 2.0.2 (2021/01/01)
; * Increased the minimum version requirement of LibMultiAccountSets (optional
;   dependency for multi-account features) to 1.7 or newer
;
; Version 2.0.1 (2020/11/28)
; * For users with multiple accounts, unbound bind-on-pickup items will no
;   longer appear if they are not eligible for trade with the selected account
;
; Version 2.0.0 (2020/11/17)
; * Restructured the addon; the tracking of multiple accounts now requires
;   LibMultiAccountSets, which is an optional library dependency; without this
;   library, users will only be able to filter against the current account
;
; Version 1.0.3 (2020/11/12)
; * Removed the filter option from invalid contexts (e.g., the Consumables tab)
; * Miscellaneous internal changes
;
; Versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.2 (2020/11/11)
; * Added German localization by @ninibini
; * For users with a single account, there will no longer be an account
;   selection submenu
; * For users with multiple accounts, the names in the account selection submenu
;   will no longer appear in a random order; instead, the current account will
;   appear first, followed by all of the other accounts in alphabetical order
;
; Version 1.0.0 (2020/11/11)
; * Initial version
