;   with two bars would cause Dressing Room to load bars from different pages
;

; * Fixed gear markers and added tooltips to them, to show you which gear piece
;   is being used by which set (and on which page)
;

;
; Version 0.9.5 (2018/09/15)
; * Added support for alchemical poisons
;   - When loading a preset with poisons, the add-on will try to equip all
;     poisons of the same level and type from your inventory, combining any
;     existing separate stacks in the process.
;   - With the "Unequip empty poison slots" option (default: enabled), the
;     add-on will unequip poisons only from those bars that contain a weapon
;     but no poison. This is intended so you can still make presets that only
;     change armour pieces, or weapons on one bar, without touching the other
;     bar in any way. If you want to explicitely unequip poisons in a certain
;     preset, simply assign a weapon (or shield) to that bar.
;   - Presets created prior to version 0.9.5 will not touch your poison slots.
;

; * Added key bindings for the maximum possible number of sets (1 through 24)
;
; Version 0.9.3 (2018/08/13)
; * Added an optional confirmation prompt when deleting a page (enabled by
;   default, can be toggled in addon settings)
;
; Version 0.9.2 (2018/03/21)
; * Fixed LUA error when attempting to use Dressing Room for the first time or
;   on a new character
;
; Version 0.9.1 (2018/03/20)
; * Fixed LUA error when migrating data from pre-0.8.0 Dressing Room to 0.9.x
;
; Version 0.9.0 (2018/03/19)
; * Dressing Room now supports multiple pages, thanks to code contributed by
;   @Toloache
;   - New pages by default will bear the name of the zone that you are currently
;     in, and can be renamed by clicking on the name
;   - If you enter a new zone whose name matches that of one of your pages,
;     Dressing Room will automatically switch to that page; this behavior can be
;     disabled in the settings
;
; Version 0.8.0 (2018/02/12)
; * Real fix for the reshuffling of skill line IDs
;
; Version 0.7.0 (2018/02/12)
